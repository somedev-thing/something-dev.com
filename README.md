## 🛑 The "Why"

Most modern websites are bloated trash. They require 32GB of RAM to render a simple landing page because developers are lazy and computers are too fast.

**I don't have that luxury.**

I code on a **2015 Mac Pro (Trash Can Edition)** with **8GB of RAM**.
If a chrome tab takes too much memory, my Spotify stutters.
If I run Docker, my room heats up by 5 degrees.

This constraint forces me to do something most "engineers" forgot how to do: **Optimize.**

## ⚡ The Stack

- **Next.js 16**: Newest version, but stripped down. No unnecessary hydration.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Because writing raw CSS is for mascocists, but shipping 5MB CSS files is for idiots.
- **Phosphor Icons**: SVGs. Clean.
- **Framer Motion**: The only heavy library I allow, because life is too short for static junk.

## 🛠️ The Rig

- **CPU**: Intel Xeon E5 (Quad Core). An ancient beast.
- **RAM**: 8GB DDR3. Yes, DDR3. Cry about it.
- **Storage**: 120GB SSD. I have to delete node_modules weekly to survive.

## 🚀 Run It

```bash
npm install # Grab a coffee, this might kill my CPU
npm run dev # Fingers crossed
```

## 📜 License

MIT. Steal it. I don't care. Just don't make it slow.
