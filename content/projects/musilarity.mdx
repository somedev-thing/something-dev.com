# Friendship is just an algorithm.

Musilarity takes your Spotify library, crunches way too much data, and tells you if you and your partner actually have compatible taste or if you're just pretending to like their indie folk playlist.

## The Horror

- **Math**: So much vector math. Why did I do this?
- **Spotify API**: Rate limits are real and they hurt.
- **Animations**: It looks pretty while it judges you.
