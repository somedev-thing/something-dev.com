# The Portfolio

I built this because my old site looked like a potato.

## Features

- **Dark Mode only**: Because light mode attracts bugs.
- **Glassmorphism**: To mak GPU go brrr.
- **MDX**: So I can write rants in Markdown.

It scores 100 on Lighthouse (if you ignore the massive WebGL background I'm planning to add).
