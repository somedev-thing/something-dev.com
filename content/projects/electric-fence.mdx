# High Voltage.

This isn't a metaphor. It's an actual app that talks to an actual electric fence.

## The Pony Protection Protocol

I live on a farm. The ponies need to stay in. The predators need to stay out.

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Checks voltage levels every minute.
- **Alerts**: Pushes notifications if the voltage drops (grass touching the wire, or a pony testing its luck).
- **Tech**: Custom PCB, ESP32, and a very angry capacitor.
